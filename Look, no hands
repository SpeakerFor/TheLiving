I will now practice typing using the skills I've learned from practicing kanji on WaniKani, the SRS flashcard system for learning Japanese.
Behildm no eyes.
Behold, no eyes.

I didn't look at the key board for either of the two above lines.  My eyes were closed for the first line though.
I didn't make any errors on the second attempt with my eyes open.
Funny how not looking at the keyboaard changes things.  Closing your eyes also has some kind of impact.
I had my eyes closed for most of the previous line but I didn't produce any major errors.
This kind of makes it more fun and getts one feeling where their fingers are falling rather than looking the screen for feedback.
The line above was also done with my eyes closed.

I am the way.
